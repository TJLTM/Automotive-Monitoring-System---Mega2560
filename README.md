# Automotive-Monitoring-System---Mega2560
OpenSource monitoring system for older vehicles without OBDII. History for this project to give some insight in why i have it designed it as i have. My dad has a 1972 ford bronco that is used to go 4x4ing and it has since the day he bought it new over heated on trails while his friends 1970 stock bronco would be idling behind his vapor locked car on the trail. Mostly this is to solve that problem by providing data. Given data systems can be fixed. I based this on a MEGA2560 because of the number of I/O pins and real time nature of this. I may in the future switch this to SBC based but so far other than a few limitations has worked. 

What is logged: 
1. Fuel Pressure x 2
2. Tempetatures x 6
3. Manifold Vacuum x 2
4. AFR x 2
5. Battery Voltage
6. Current drawn from Alternator 
7. RPM 
8. Oil Pressure
9. GPS Data
